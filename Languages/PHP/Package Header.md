# Package Header

I think it is important that not only do we follow a set coding standard such as **PSR-4** but also some sort of 
internal layout, so packages are formatted in a similar way each time.

An example here in PHP, is when we create a script/class that we include the following header :

    <?php
    /**
     * @author Your Name
     * @team Open Dev
     * @package Your Package Name
     * @version 1.x-alpha
     * @license GNU
     */
     
    // YOUR CODE STARTS HERE //
